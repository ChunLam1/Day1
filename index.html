<p>Write a paragraph containing some span or em tags of <span class = "color">different colors</span>. Spans are inline elements, meaning that their
default display property value is <i>inline</i>. Those elements will follow the <span class = "color">horizontal</span>span flow of a document. Inline elements
go next to another inline element so you won't have any line break until you decide do insert one (like here with a br
tag).<br>Images are inline element too !<img class= "" src =""> That's a simple but super
important point to remember ! Feel free to dif deeper with the MDN doc.
